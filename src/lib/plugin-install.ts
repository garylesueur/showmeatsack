Use the [installation guide](${origin}/install) for step-by-step setup and copyable commands.

The [Meatsack marketplace](${MARKETPLACE_HREF}) includes askmeatsack.com, showmeatsack.com, and sharemeatsack.com. Each plugin packages its hosted MCP connection and workflow skill. Install the ones you need.

### Codex

\`\`\`sh
${PLUGIN_INSTALL.codex}
\`\`\`

Restart the desktop app, open Plugins, choose Meatsack, then install ${PLUGIN_INSTALL.displayName}. Adding the marketplace makes all three plugins available; install the ones you need.

### Claude Code

\`\`\`text
${PLUGIN_INSTALL.claude}
\`\`\`

Confirm the Claude Code install in the plugin panel, then start a new session.

### Cursor

On Teams or Enterprise, a team admin opens Dashboard → Plugins & MCPs → Add Marketplace → Import from Repo. Use ${MARKETPLACE_HREF}, review the plugins, set access, and save. Install ${PLUGIN_INSTALL.displayName} from Customize.

For a local install:

\`\`\`sh
${PLUGIN_INSTALL.cursor}
\`\`\`

Restart Cursor or run Developer: Reload Window after copying the plugin. Confirm its skill and MCP server in Customize. Local plugin imports must be allowed.
